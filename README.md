###  **OVERVIEW**
  
Welcome to the cadence repository!

My journey to enhance digital  skills using cadence tool. This pratice is to strngthen my foundation in digital design by solving variety of verilog problems on a daily basis. 

### **HIGHLIGHTS**

**Tools used** :- cadence Tools.

**Focus Area** :- digital circuits, Combinational and sequential ciruits, testbench creation, layout, simulation and synthesis.

**GOALS** :- 

1.Develop a strong foundation in digital design.

            2. Gain proficiency in using cadence for Design and simulation.
            
            3. Build a habit of daily problem-solving.

### **REPOSITORY STRUCTURE** :-
This repository is organized into folders for each containing the problem statements, digital circuits, and testbenches. Each folder includes:


. **digital circuits**: The Digital circuits of the solution.


. **Testbench**: The testbench used the validate the solution.


.**Simulation Results**: Screenshots of the simulation results (where applicable).


. **Schematic Result**: Schematic view of the Design.
